# Webpack

Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.

### Core Concepts:
Entry (which module webpack should use to begin building)
Output (property tells webpack where to emit the bundles it creates and how to name these files)
Loaders (to process other types of files and convert them into valid modules that can be consumed)
Plugins (to perform a wider range of tasks like bundle optimization)
Mode (you can enable webpack's built-in optimizations that correspond to each environment)
Browser Compatibility (Webpack supports all browsers)
